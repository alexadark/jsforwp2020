# Gatsby Starters

Starters are a way to quickly create Gatsby sites with similar functionality.

You download the entire prebuilt gatsby site and customize from there

<Steps>

- No connection to the starter, they diverge immediately, there is no way to update them if the starter updates
- If you created multiple sites using the same starter, and want to make the same update on all of them, you'd have to do them individually

</Steps>
