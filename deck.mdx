# What are Gatsby themes ?

Gatsby themes abstract a configuration into an installable package

Technically they are gastby plugins including a gatsby-config.js file

<Steps>

- pre-configured shared functionality
- data sourcing
- design

</Steps>
<Notes>
You can think of Gatsby themes as separate Gatsby sites that can be put together and allow you to split up a larger Gatsby project!

# Gatsby themes vs Gatsby Starters

They both provide boilerplate, functionality and style, to bootstrap your project

<Steps>

- initial design and styles
- initial plugins functionality
- initial pages generator and website sections logic

</Steps>

---

# Gatsby Starters

A starter is a boilerplate Gatsby site that users can copy and customize. Once modified, a starter maintains no connection to its source.

<Steps>

- your default configuration lives directly in your site
- No connection to the starter, they diverge immediately, there is no way to update them if the starter updates
- If you created multiple sites using the same starter, and want to make the same update on all of them, you'd have to do them individually

</Steps>

# Gatsby themes

Gatsby themes allow Gatsby site functionality to be packaged as a standalone product for others (and yourself!) to easily reuse

<Steps>

- all of your default configuration lives in an npm package.
- themes are versioned packages that can be updated like any other package.
- If you created multiple sites using the same theme, you can just update the central theme to push changes across all of them
- Themes are composable: You could install a blog theme alongside a notes theme, alongside an e-commerce theme (and so forth)

</Steps>

# Gatsby themes vs WordPress Themes

<Split>

 <Box>

#### Gatsby Themes

<ul>
  <li>updtatable: yes</li>
  <li>User Options: yes</li>
  <li>Composable: yes, horizontally and vertically</li>
  <li>could provide functionality only: yes</li>
  <li>customization: trough shadowing</li>

</ul>

 </Box>

  <Box>

#### WordPress Themes

<ul>
  <li>updtatable: yes</li>
  <li>User Options: yes</li>
  <li>Composable: no</li>
  <li>could provide functionality only: no</li>
  <li>customization: trough child themes</li>
</ul>

  </Box>

</Split>

<Notes>
  child themes are 2 different things in gatsby and WordPress in wordpress A
  child theme in WordPress is a sub theme that inherits all the functionality,
  features, and style of its parent theme. Child themes are a safe way to modify a WordPress theme
  Gatsby themes can compose horizontally and vertically. Vertical composition refers to the classic “parent/child” relationship. A child theme declares a parent theme in the child theme’s plugins array.
